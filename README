This project aimed to redesign the current eMuseum search engine (http://sammlungen-archive.zhdk.ch/code/emuseum.asp) by finding an alternative concept to it and develop it in Flash/AS3.

Our idea was to develop a search engine which uses tags to sort and manage content. Dynamic search queries should be made possible by offering the possibility to add/delete filter options at any time. Statistic feedback of the amount of the currently generated query results and the number of results per tag (the tag's 'weight') should also be focussed. Also, a browsing experience should be given to the user.

The resulting product is a prototype which should give insight into our concept idea and show the usage of our application.
